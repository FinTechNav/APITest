ApiKeyHeader:
  type: apiKey
  in: header
  name: x-api-key
  description: |
    All API requests must be authenticated using an API key. The API key should be included in the `x-api-key` header of each request.

    ### API Key Format

    ```
    x-api-key: <api-key>
    ```

    ### Environment-Specific Keys

    We provide two distinct API keys for different environments. The base URL for both environments is the same (`https://api.omni.integratedcommerce.io/v1`), but the keys are different.

    #### Sandbox Environment
    - Format: `key_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
    - Use this key for development and testing

    #### Production Environment
    - Format: `key_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
    - Use this key for live production traffic

    ### Error Responses

    If authentication fails, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "1000",
        "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Rate Limiting

    API requests are subject to rate limiting based on your subscription plan. Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

    - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed per time window
    - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current time window
    - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the rate limit will reset

    When you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
