title: Integrated Commerce Omni-Channel Payment API
description: |
  ### Introduction

  The Integrated Commerce Omni-Channel Payment API is a RESTful API that provides a unified interface for processing payments across multiple channels. This API enables developers to integrate payment processing capabilities into their applications with a single set of endpoints, simplifying implementation and reducing development time.

  The API supports integration in both the United States and Canada, using USD and CAD currencies.

  ### Features

  #### Card Present Transactions

  The API supports the following Card Present transaction types:
  - Authorization: Verification with the Issuer if the card is valid for payment.  The authorization amount is reserved, but not captured/settled.
  - Capture: Complete a previously authorized transaction.  The cardholder is billed for the transaction, and the transaction is settled to the merchant.
  - Sale: Combined authorization and capture in a single step.
  - Refund: Process reversal of a previous sale transaction (automatically performs a void if the transaction is in the current batch, or a refund if already settled)

  Card Present transactions are processed through Verifone T650c (countertop) and T650p (portable) Android-based payment terminals.

  #### Card Not Present Transactions

  For online payments, the API provides Hosted payment pages/iframes for payment transactions and secure card data collection for tokenization.  The API supports the following Card Not Present transaction types:
  - Authorization: Verification with the Issuer if the card is valid for payment.  The authorization amount is reserved, but not captured/settled.
    - Includes AVS (Address Verification Service) and CVV validation support
  - Capture: Complete a previously authorized transaction.  The cardholder is billed for the transaction, and the transaction is settled to the merchant.
  - Sale: Combined authorization and capture in a single step.
    - Includes AVS (Address Verification Service) and CVV validation support
  - Refund: Process reversal of a previous sale transaction (automatically performs a void if the transaction is in the current batch, or a refund if already settled)
  - AVS (Address Verification Service) and CVV validation

  #### Tokenization

  The API implements a tokenization system that:
  - Creates payment tokens from both Card Present and Card Not Present transactions
  - Maintains tokens that work across all channels (in-person and online)
  - Supports token management operations (create, update, delete)

  #### Webhooks

  Real-time notifications via webhooks for:
  - Transaction events ([sales](#operation-post-SaleCompleted), [authorizations](#operation-post-AuthCompleted), [captures](#operation-post-CaptureCompleted), [refunds](#operation-post-RefundCompleted))
  - Token operations ([creation](#operation-post-TokenCreated), [updates](#operation-post-TokenUpdated), [deletion](#operation-post-TokenRemoved))

  #### Payment Methods

  The API uses "Payment Methods" as the foundation for processing transactions. Each payment method has a unique paymentMethodId that represents a specific way to accept payments:

  - **Physical Terminals**: For Card Present, in-person transactions
  - **Virtual Terminals**: For Card Not Present, online transactions
  - **Tokenized Cards**: For processing Card On File transactions where customer payment information has been securely stored for recurring or future transactions

  When you call the [`GET /payment-methods`](#operation-getpaymentmethods) endpoint, the API returns a list of all payment methods available to your account. This includes physical payment terminals for in-store transactions and virtual payment terminals for online payments.

  For example, a virtual payment method might be a customized checkout iframe for your website, a dedicated payment form for your mobile app, or a hosted payment page for email invoices. Each virtual method can be tailored for different use cases â€“ some optimized for desktop browsers, others for mobile devices, or specialized for recurring subscriptions.

  Each payment method includes details such as its ID, type (physical or virtual), currency, description, and whether it's set as a default. This information helps you determine which payment method to use for different transaction scenarios.
