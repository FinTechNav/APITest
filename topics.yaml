    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.

    ## Error Response Format

    All error responses follow this format:

    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "ERROR_CODE",
        "message": "A human-readable error message"
      }
    }
    ```
