    # Getting Started

    This section covers the basics of getting started with our API.

    ## Authentication

    First, you'll need to obtain an API key for authentication.

    ## Making Your First Request

    Once you have your API key, you can make your first API request.

    # Authentication

    All API requests must include your API key in the `x-api-key` header.

    ```
    x-api-key: your_api_key_here
    ```

    ## API Key Management

    Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly.

    # Error Handling

    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.

    ## Error Response Format

    All error responses follow this format:

    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "ERROR_CODE",
        "message": "A human-readable error message"
      }
    }
    ```
