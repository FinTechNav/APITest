    # Hosted Payment Form

    The Integrated Commerce Omni-Channel Payment API offers a secure Hosted Payment Form (HPF) solution that simplifies payment collection while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.

    ## How It Works

    Our Hosted Payment Form system uses a session-based approach rather than static iframes. Here's how the flow works:

    <div style="padding-left: 20px; border-left: 3px solid #0969da; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    1. <strong>Initiate Session</strong>: Your backend server makes a POST request to our API (e.g., <code>/payment-methods/virtual</code>, <code>/transactions/virtual-sale</code>, etc.) with your transaction details.<br><br>

    2. <strong>Receive Session URL</strong>: Our API returns a short-lived, unique iframe URL specific to this transaction, along with a session ID and expiration timestamp.<br><br>

    3. <strong>Embed HPF</strong>: You embed this iframe URL in your payment page. The iframe contains a fully-styled, responsive payment form.<br><br>

    4. <strong>Customer Enters Payment Info</strong>: The customer enters their payment information (card details, billing address) directly into our secure form, which is isolated from your website's environment.<br><br>

    5. <strong>Payment Processing</strong>: When the customer submits the form, we process the payment in our secure environment.<br><br>

    6. <strong>Result Communication</strong>: Results are communicated back to your system in three ways:
       <ul>
         <li>Redirect: If you provided a <code>returnUrl</code> parameter, the customer will be redirected there with status information. The URL will include parameters like <code>paymentMethodId</code>, <code>resultCode</code>, <code>cardType</code>, <code>transactionId</code>, and your <code>referenceId</code>.</li>
         <li>postMessage: A JavaScript event is sent to your parent window with transaction details</li>
         <li>Webhook: The complete transaction result is delivered via the appropriate webhook</li>
       </ul>
       <br>Your page can then parse these parameters to display appropriate confirmation or error messages. Additionally, you'll receive a webhook notification with the complete transaction details that you can use for order fulfillment and record-keeping.
    </div>

    ## Error Handling

    <div style="padding-left: 20px; border-left: 3px solid #0969da; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    If a payment session experiences an error or expires, the customer will see an appropriate error message. Your implementation should handle various response statuses, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Successful payments (resultCode = 0)</li>
      <li>Declined transactions</li>
      <li>Expired sessions</li>
      <li>Processing errors</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    ## Implementation Best Practices

    <div style="padding-left: 20px; border-left: 3px solid #0969da; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <h4 style="margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px;">Keep Session IDs Private</h4>
      <p>Never expose the full session ID in client-side code outside the iframe src.</p>
      
      <h4 style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 16px;">Implement Proper Origin Validation</h4>
      <p>Always verify the origin of postMessage events.</p>
      
      <h4 style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 16px;">Handle Timeouts Gracefully</h4>
      <p>Sessions expire after a short period, so provide clear messaging to users if this happens.</p>
      
      <h4 style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 16px;">Test with Our Test Cards</h4>
      <p>Use our test cards during your integration development.</p>
      
      <h4 style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 16px;">Responsive Design</h4>
      <p>Ensure your payment page layout accommodates the iframe appropriately on all devices.</p>
